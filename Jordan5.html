            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <p>The Air Jordan 5 is known for its distinctive "shark tooth" midsole, clear plastic side panels, and
                high-quality leather that offers durability and comfort. While it is versatile and holds good resale
                value, it can be expensive, prone to creasing, and not the best choice for intense basketball play. </p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The Air Jordan V, released in 1990, was designed to match Michael Jordan's aggressive playing style with
                features like a sharktooth design inspired by a WWII plane, translucent "iced" outsoles, and lace-lock
                toggles. The shoe also had a visible Air-Sole unit, mesh from earlier models, and an embroidered Jumpman
                logo with 3M reflectivity on the tongue. The ankle collar was designed to provide support while still
                being flexible, and the higher cut offered more protection. The Grape Purple/Emerald colorway was a
                first for a basketball shoe, bringing even more attention to Jordan's game. That season, Jordan made his
                sixth straight All-Star appearance, won his fourth consecutive scoring title, and was named to the
                All-NBA and All-Defensive First Teams, although the Bulls still couldn't beat Detroit in the conference
                finals.

        <div class="cons">
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <p>but potential downsides include theirÂ high price point, sometimes limited colorways, and the possibility
                of the upper creasing easily depending on the materials used</p>
