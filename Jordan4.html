            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <p> The Air Jordan 4 is known for its iconic "cage" structure and stylish silhouette, with many colorways
                that can easily be paired with different outfits. It offers good durability with leather uppers, decent
                impact absorption from the visible Air cushioning, and a variety of popular color combinations.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>After the success of the Air Jordan III, Tinker Hatfield designed the Air Jordan IV, which was one of the
                most comfortable Jordans at the time. The Jumpman logo returned on the tongue with "Flight" below it.
                The AJ IV kept features from the AJ III, like the sculpted midsole and visible Air unit, and added new
                ones, such as nubuck material and mesh for better breathability. It also included plastic parts for
                support and a "Nike Air" heel tab. Mars Blackmon returned in the ad campaign, and the AJ IV sold out
                when it was re-released in 1999. Michael Jordan wore them to his fifth consecutive All-Star game and won
                his third scoring title. One of the most famous moments in the AJ IV was when Jordan made his
                game-winning shot, known as "The Shot," against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the playoffs.

        <div class="cons">
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <p>The Air Jordan 4 may have fit issues, such as being slightly narrow or causing heel slippage due to the
                design of the heel tab. Additionally, its cushioning doesn't provide as much support for high-impact
                activities, and the resale price can be high, with material quality sometimes varying between releases.
