            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The first Air Jordan sneakers came out in 1985 and started a big trend for cool shoes. Michael Jordan, a
                talented basketball player, was chosen by the Chicago Bulls and made a big deal with Nike, even though
                he wasn’t famous yet. Nike made the special shoes just for him, but the NBA didn’t like them because
                they didn’t follow the rules for team colors. Michael wore them anyway, and Nike paid the fine for him.
                He wore the shoes while winning an award for being the best new player that year! The shoes had a
                special Nike Swoosh logo and a cool Wings logo with a basketball and wings on it. They were made with
                tough leather and had holes in the toes to keep feet cool.

        <div class="cons">
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <p>The Air Jordan 1 can feel stiff and heavy at first, and the soft leather may crease easily, especially
                around the toe. Some limited editions are expensive, and while designed for basketball, they may not be
                the best choice for high-impact activities.
