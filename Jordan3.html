            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p> In 1988, the Air Jordan III became a huge deal, partly because of a famous ad campaign with actor Spike Lee, who played a character named Mars Blackmon. Designer Tinker Hatfield, who would go on to design many more Air Jordans, made the AJ III stand out with cool features like elephant print on the sides and luxurious materials, which were new for basketball shoes. The AJ III also introduced the Jumpman logo, showing Michael Jordan dunking, and had a visible Air-Sole cushion in the heel for comfort. Jordan wore the AJ III while playing his best basketball yet, earning MVP and winning his second Slam Dunk Contest title. The AJ III was so popular it was re-released in 1994.

        <div class="cons">
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <p>The Air Jordan 3 has poor traction on the court due to its rubber outsole and a bulkier fit, with a spacious toe box that can feel less precise. It also requires a break-in period for comfort and can be expensive, especially for certain colorways.
